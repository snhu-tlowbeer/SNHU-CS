    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

For interpretation of user needs, speaking with the client and asking what they need of the program gives details to determine what features the program needs. 
The needs of the user are converted to user stories that describe what the program will do in smaller parts and helps determine what parts the program needs to be built to specifications given.
My approach to developing programs is to start with the main class or similar, where all functions are called from, then build each function testing as i go that it works.
Agile processes I hope to incorporate into future work includes breaking down the work into more smaller piecees and working on one at a time, similar to daily standups, but alone for personal projects.
In software development, the most important part of being a good team member is clear documentation and communication.

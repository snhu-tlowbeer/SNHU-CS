# SNHU-CS

This project was to design a system for the client, DriverPass, to build a system for scheduling driving lessons for their students, and giving feedback from drivers, while remaining updated from the DMV for requirements.
I feel I did a particularly good job at determining the requirements for the functions of the system, but if I were to go back, I would revise the limitations of the system, going more in depth as to what it is missing and what could cause it to fail.
For interpreting the user's needs, I based my requirements off the interview transcript and added in things that, while not outright stated, would be necessary for the system to work as they required.
Considering the user's needs are important so that the system functions as the client wants for the end user without frustrations or issues, so that people will continue to use the system and not just stop and move to something that works better.
For designing software, I typically will try to figure out the needs of the system, then work on
